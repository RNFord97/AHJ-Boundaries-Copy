# AHJ-Boundaries-Copy
Data and Scripts associated with the CRS Project subtask AHJ Database. This includes the raw data on California zipcodes, city and county boundaries, climate zone identifiers, population, and personnel information. All analyis and scripts are in the 'Analysis' folder. This includes the Composite California GeoData spreadsheet, the Composite Position Search Results spreadsheet, the 2023 City & County extractions from Government Compensation California, and the corresponding City & County test/train spreadsheets for the Classification Model. Preliminary analysis is done in the 'AHJ Database_California Built Environment Personnel Mapping 2025' notebook. The 'ClassificationModel_TrainTest' notebook is strictly for creating test/train outputs from a base spreadsheet.
